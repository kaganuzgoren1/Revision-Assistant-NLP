# Revision-Assistant-NLP

# My dissertation project for the Artificial Intelligence and Adaptive Systems MSc at the University of Sussex.
A Revision Assistant system that extracts topics and keywords by LDA and BERT from the PowerPoint documents uploaded is created. Then, the RA creates questions based on the extracted KWs. KeyBert is used as the KeyWord and KeyPhrase extraction method. KeyBERT is a technique for extracting keywords that are most reflective of the underlying text document by using BERT embeddings and cosine similarity. A detailed explanation of the KeyBert model exists at https://maartengr.github.io/KeyBERT/. LDA is a statistical method that extracts the unigram Keywords regarding the extracted topic with a probability. By using T5 transformers and embeddings, random questions about the KWs and KPs are generated. mrm8488/t5-base-finetuned-question-generation-ap is the model that is used for the QG part. A detailed explanation of the author's code exists in the HuggingFace library. SpaCy and WordNet are used for the preprocessing steps. The preprocessing steps aim to increase the semantical and linguistic connections of the sentences and titles in the PPTX documents.
